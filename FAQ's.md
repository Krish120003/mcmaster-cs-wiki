# FAQ's

## general

### My question has no answer here?

If all else fails, ask on Discord, and if you find an answer that others could benifit from, add it here.

### Can I edit a page?

Yes, if you don't feel confident in changing something, add a comment on the page as a suggestion.

## editor

### My tables work in the editor preview but not in the normal view? 

Ensure your table has the same amount of vertical bars ( | ) on every line, and that the line below the headers (example: ---|---|---) is the correct length.
