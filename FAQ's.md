# FAQ's

## general

### My question has no answer here?

If all else fails, ask on Discord, and if you find an answer that others could benifit from, add it here.

### Can I edit a page?

Yes, if you don't feel confident in changing something, add a comment on the page as a suggestion.

## editor

### How do I write math equations?

The wiki uses a light-weight version of LaTeX calledKaTeX to render math, all supported functions can be found [here](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html), and symbols can be found quickly using [detexify](http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html)

### My tables work in the editor preview but not in the normal view? 

Ensure your table has the same amount of vertical bars ( | ) on every line, and that the line below the headers (example: ---|---|---) is the correct length.
