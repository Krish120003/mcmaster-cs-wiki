|------|-----|-----|----|
| COMPSCI 3DM3 | Intro to Data Mining| [Lingyang Chu](/professors/lingyang-chu) | 4/5 |
| COMPSCI 3MR3 | ~~Mobile Robots and Autonomous Systems~~ Course Removed for 2023 | Unannounced (previously Stoyo but he said he ain't teaching it) | N/A |

### ~~COMPSCI 3MR3 - Mobile Robots and Autonomous Systems~~
New course (as of 2023) ~~taught by Stoyo~~
Apparently Stoyo isn't teaching this year's course smh
THE COURSE IS FUCKING GONE?????????


### 3DP3 - Data Privacy
- Been called "basically a stats proof course"
- 4 proof based assignments
- Closed book midterm/exam
- Up to 7% free as bonus marks for participation/course evals

### COMPSCI 3DM3 - Intro to Data Mining
- A machine learning course that covers more topics but less in depth than COMPSCI 4ML3 (both courses have some overlap as such)
- Usually has very little practical content (i.e. not much programming) and is mostly theory based
- Has been said that COMPSCI 3DM3 (Intro to Data Mining) is a better way to prep for COMPSCI 4ML3 (Intro to Machine Learning) than Linear Optimization due to not using much linear optimization in 4ML3
- Is considered to have interesting content and has had online quizzes in the past, but also has been a generally unorganized course


## Unknown
// If you know if/when these courses are running, pls fix

### SFWRENG 3GB3 - Game design

### SFWRENG 4J03 - Communications Systems

## Not Running

### COMPSCI 3EA3 - Software and System Correctness
