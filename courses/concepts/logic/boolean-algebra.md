# Boolean Algebra

Boolean algebra consits of the truth values and logical operators.

## truth values

A truth value or logical value can either be true or false (often noted as 1/0 or T/F). Every bit in a computer is a truth value represented by high or low voltage. In programming, these are represented by the Boolean data type.

## logical operators

## propositional logic

Propositional logic is closely connected to boolean algebra, but focuses more on deductive reasoning, and building up theorems.
