- Assume we are sampling from a population which we know is normally distributed, $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, where we know neither $\sigma^2$ nor $\mu$.
    - If $n$ is very big, then $\frac{\overline X - \mu}{\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}} \approx N(0, 1)$
- What should we do if we can't guarantee $n$ is large?
    - Answer: introduce a new (family) of distributions.

has a student's t-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.
- As $n \to \infty$, $T_{n-1} \to N(0, 1)$
- To find a $100(1 - \alpha)\%$ CI on the mean of a normal distribution, variance unknown, we find a number $t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}, n-1}$ such that

>     P\left(-t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}, n-1} \le T_{n-1} \le t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}, n-1\right)&= 1 - \alpha \\
>     P\left(\overline X - \left(t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}, n-1}\right) \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}} \le \mu \le \overline X + \left(t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}, n-1}\right) \frac{S}{\sqrt{n}}\right) &= 1 - \alpha
> \end{aligned}$$

#### Example
Out of all the Stats 3Y03/3J04 students, 12 write the upcoming test early. We found $\overline x = 77\%$, $s = 13.6\%$. Find a $95\%$ CI on the mean of the entire class.

##### Solution
$$\begin{aligned}
    100(1 - \alpha) &= 95 \\
    \alpha &= 0.05 \\
    \frac{\alpha}{2} &= 0.025
\end{aligned}$$

We know the end points of a CI will be
$$\begin{aligned}
    \overline x \pm \left(t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}, 11}\right) \frac{s}{\sqrt{12}} 
    &= 
        0.77 \pm \left(t_{0.025, 11}\right) \frac{0.136}{\sqrt{12}}
    \\&= 
        0.77 \pm \left(2.201\right) \frac{0.136}{\sqrt{12}}
    \\&=
        0.77 \pm 0.0867
\end{aligned}$$

##### Remark
One sided CI's are similar; use $t_{\alpha, n-1}$ instead of $t_{\frac{\alpha}{2}, n-1}$.
