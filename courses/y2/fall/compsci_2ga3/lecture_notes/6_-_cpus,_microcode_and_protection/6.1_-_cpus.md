# abstraction to the rescue
- Hardware needs to be very complex to answer demands
- Difficult to design hardware
- Turn design and verification into a programming problem
- Microcode is a way to offload some complexity to software

# cpu protection modes
- microcode key for implementing execution modes
- not all instructions available for all "users"
- E.g., some instructions only available for boot loader, others only for OS.
- protected regions in memory, protected instructions

# microcode
- *A way to instruct the processor how to implement an instruction*
    - Way to implement more instructions with lower level instructions
- One instruction set visible to programmer
- Different instruction set available internally
- Macro instructions are coded in microcode
- Microcontroller(s) process microcode to emulate macrocode

## Pros
- Less prone to errors compared to hardware design
- easier to implement
- Ease of extension and modification
- Offers another level of abstraction

## Cons
- More overhead than dedicated hardware design
- Variable cost for macro instructions. Depends on number of micro instructions
- Microcontroller needs to run very fast
