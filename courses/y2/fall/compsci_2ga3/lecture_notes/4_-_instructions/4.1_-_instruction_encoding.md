# Instruction Set Architecture
## simplified conditions
- Fixed-length instructions 
    - simpler hardware, larger memory footprint
- Program loaded in memory
    - assume no OS running, no bootloader, architecture is in a running state
- Instruction pointer initialized
- Processor already running
    - don't cover mode switching
## hardware implementation
- 16 general purpose registers
- separate instruction/data memory (Harvard)
- byte addressable memory
- 32-bit architecture

# Sample Instructions
- `add` performs addition of two numbers stored in registers
    - `add rX, rA, rB` $\equiv$ `rX = rA+rB`
- `load` reads an integer from a memory location and stores it into a register
    - `load rX, off(rA)`$\equiv$ `rX=memory[rA+off]`
        - `off` - an immediate/literal value. Can be negative
        - `r1` could be holding the first value of an array
- `store` writes an integer from a register to a memory location
    - `store rB, off(rA)` $\equiv$ `memory[rA+off]=rB`
- `jump` moves the instruction pointer to a new location, specified in a register
    - `jump off(rA)`$\equiv$`PC=rA+off`

# Design Decisions
- `rX` - always a destination register
- `rA` - always an argument in addition
- Three instructions use offsets: a way to encode an *immediate value* in the instruction
- only follow data paths in the subsequent hardware design

- Operation - the opcode
- Wasting bits here, but it's to make the hardware simpler
    - Jump could have 8 more bits, but hardware would be more complex
- There are 16  bits for a register to identify the [16 general purpose registers](/courses/y2/fall/compsci_2ga3/lecture_notes/4_-_instructions/4.1_-_instruction_encoding.md).
