# high and low level languages
## high level languages
- one to many translation
- hardware independent
- application oriented
- general purpose
- powerful abstractions

## low level languages
- one to one translation
- hardware specific
- systems programming oriented
- special purpose
- few abstractions

# use cases
- programming microcontrollers for specific hardware interface
- device driver code (lower half)
- boot loaders
- memory controllers

# assembly syntax
```
[label:] op_name [operand1, operand2...] # comment
```
- comments are essential for readability and maintenance
    - line comments: document result of the line
    - block comments: explain high-level logic for following code block
- operand order is (not) standard
- operand encoding:
    - register addresses use unique symbolic names (`r0..rX, acc, cmp`)
    - memory addresses as immediate values or symbolic variables defined in data section

# basic patterns
## conditions
### high level language
```c
if (a==0) {
    // conditino holds block
}
// program continues
```

### low level language
```armasm
cmp r0,1   ; compute conditino flag
bne false  ; if conditino does not hold, branch to false
; conditin holds block
false:     ; program continues
```

## for loop
### high level language
```c
for (int i = 0; i<N; ++i) {
    // loop body
}
// program continues
```

### low level language
```armasm
load r0, 0          ; r0 is loop counter=0

for:
    cmp r0, r10     ; compute condition, set flag
    be endfor       ; branch endfor on equal (be)
    
    ; loop body code goes here
    
    add r0, r0, r1  ; increment r0
    jump for        ; back to loop
endfor:
; program continues
```

## while loop
### high level language
```c
while (cond) {
    // loop body
}
// program continues
```

### low level language
```armasm
while:
    ; compute condition, set flag
    bne endwhile      ; condition does not hold, branch to endwhile
    ; loop body code goes here
    
    jump while        ; back to loop
endwhile:
; program continues
```

# subroutines and functions
```armasm
funct_x:
    ; subroutine body code
    return ; returns to call
    
main:
    ; main code body
    jsr funct_x ; jump to subroutine
    ; main body continues
```
- register windows for passing arguments and retrieving results

# assembly macros
```armasm
macro addmem a,b,c   ; macro definition
    load  a, r1      ; load memory to r1
    load  b, r2      ; load memory to r2
    add   r3, r1, r2 ; add data, store in r3
    store r3, c      ; copy result to memory
```
- call macro in main function `addmem 0x00F1 0x1234 0xAC32
- pre-processor copy-pastes in place
- no checks done by pre-processor
