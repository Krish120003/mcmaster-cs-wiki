# Bus Architecture
> ***Definition***
> A bus is a digital communication mechanism that allows two or more devices to exchange data.

- Different designs (open, proprietary)
- Different applications
- Different interface controllers
- Interface controller implements bus access protocol

# Control Address and Data Lines
![](/images/20221124111229.png)
- Different lines dedicated to different functions
- ***Control lines***: take control of bus, request transfers, set signals interrupts
- ***Address lines***: transmit the address in a fetch/store operation
- ***Data lines***: transmit data.

# Data/Address Multiplexing

- When data wider than interface width $\to$ data multiplexing
- More optimization possible: joint data/address multiplexing
- Key idea: use address lines and data lines together
- implement protocol, transfer address and data sequentially over shared lines
