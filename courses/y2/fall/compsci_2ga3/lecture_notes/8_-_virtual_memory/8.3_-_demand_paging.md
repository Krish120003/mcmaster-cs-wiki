# Page Table Storage
- Multiple page tables need to be maintained
- Dynamic Memory allocation
- Page table sizes can grow quickly
- Where to store page table?

# Translation Lookaside Buffer
- Problem: Now MMU needs to query page table $P_t$ from memory
- Each address lookup now costs 2 memory lookups
- Performance degradation

##### Solution
- Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)
- Like a cache: keep record of $F = P_t[N]$. If page $N$ looked up a second time, return local copy of $F$.
    - when full, will kick least used value out and replace with something else
- Parallel lookup through TLB and request to memory

# Software/Hardware Synchronization
| Software                              | Hardware                                |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Configure hardware                    | Handle address shipping                 |
| monitor page users                    | record when a page is used              |
| move pages between memory and storage | detect access attempt to a missing page |

> ***Typical Operating Sequence***
> - MMU attempts to load address $a$ on page $P$
> - MMUY checks page table $P_t[P]$. Check if ***presence bit*** is set.
> - if no:
>     - MMU raises page fualt
>     - OS handles page fault by loading $P$ from hard drive and updating $P_t$
>     - If no space left in memory, OS swaps a page with a ***use bit*** set to 0
>     - If ***modified bit*** is set, page needs to be saved, otherwise discarded.
> - If yes, MMU looks up address and updates ***use bit*** and ***modified bit***.

# [Virtual Memory and Caching](/courses/y2/fall/compsci_2ga3/lecture_notes/8_-_virtual_memory/8.3_-_demand_paging.md)
- What address does the cache hold?
- Virtual ones, with a process ID
- When running process switches, cache usually flushed
