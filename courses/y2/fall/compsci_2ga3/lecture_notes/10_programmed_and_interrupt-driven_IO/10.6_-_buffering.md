# Buffering
- System calls expensive: require synchronization
- Buffering calls: collect number of calls and perform simultaneously.
- Special procedures for read/write buffers
- On average we expect that a single call takes $M$ cycles for operations and $N$ cycles for overhead.
- $K$ calls then cost $K \times (M+N)$
- If we buffer, $K$ calls cost $K \times M + N$
