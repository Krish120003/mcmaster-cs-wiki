# Introduction to Data Mining

## About This Course

What should you do when you are facing a huge amount of complicated data from real life applications? This course introduces the core techniques in big data analytics, namely knowledge discovery in databases (KDD), also known as data mining (DM). It focuses on the principles, fundamental algorithms, implementations, and applications.

### Textbook and references

(Official textbook) Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques (3rd ed.), Jiawei Han, Micheline Kamber, and Jian Pei, Morgan Kaufmann, 2011.

### Grading Scheme

Five written assignments (5% per assignment, 25% in total)
Mid-term exam (35%)
Final exam (40%)
Bonus marks (10%, the final marks will not exceed 100%)

Note1: Detailed course policy is included in the slides of the first lecture.

    Note2: The instructor reserves the right to conduct deferred examinations orally.

    Note3: The submission due time (i.e., deadline) for all assignments and projects is strict. Overdue submissions (even if its late by 1 second) will not be graded and will receive ZERO marks. Extension of due time may be granted upon valid MSAF request.

    Note4: Please double check your assignments before submitting to Avenue. Faulty submissions due to any reason will be graded as zero and a re-submission will NOT be accepted.

    Note5: For every posted marks, the marks will be FINAL 3 days after it is published. So, if you have a different opinion on your marks, you must inform the instructor within 3 days after the publishing date of the marks.

### Prerequisites

Comprehensive understanding and skills in data structures, such as linked data structures, B-trees, and hash functions.
Analysis of algorithms and time complexity.
Operating systems, main memory and disk management, file systems.
Elementary probability theory and statistics, such as random variables, distributions, probability mass functions, sampling, and statistical tests.
