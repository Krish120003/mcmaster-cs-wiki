# Bus Address Space
- All devices connected to the bus see the data/address/control bits sent
- Only device with matching address responds
- Every device on bus as a unique set of addresses assigned.

- each address corresponds to a particular device function
- Unique addresses: each socket has a range pre-assigned.

# Unified Address Space
- I/O device addresses are in the same space as memory addresses
- Fetch/store to device same as fetch/store to memory
- MMU manages address allocation and raises faults when accessing a *hole* in address space

# I/O Bridge
- Q: How is all this data flow managed on a single bus?
- Answer: it is not
- A modern architecture has one primary bus and several auxiliary buses
- Connection between buses done by a *bridge*

> ***I/O bridge***
> A device that connects between two buses, provides address translation, and relays data. Typically has two interface controllers, one for each bus.

# Bridging and Address Spaces
- Bridge provides address translation in the unified address space
- Addresses on the main bus can be kept constant, mapped differently on auxiliary bus
