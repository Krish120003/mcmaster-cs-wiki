# Operand Addressing Modes
![](/images/20221019110703.png)
Different options that each operand might mean
1. Immediate value encoded in instruction
    - inside of instruction register
    - fastest mode because data is fetched and immediately accessible
    - directly do operations on it
2. Value in register, register id in instruction
    - slower than *1.*
    - It can be any value
3. Value in memory, memory address in instruction
4. Value in memory, memory address in register, register id in instruction
5. Value in memory, memory address in different memory location encoded in instruction
