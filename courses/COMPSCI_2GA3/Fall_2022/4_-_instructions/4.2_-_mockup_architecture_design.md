# Implementing the Architecture

- Job is to increment the instruction pointer. 
- Adds 4 bits since each address is 4 bits wide. The result is that the pointer moves 4 bytes in memory
- 16 bit architecture adding 2 bits, 664 bit architecture adding 8 bits

- Data out - the instruction itself

- `A` - 4 bits, `B` - 4 bits, `dst` - 4 bits, `offset` - 15 bits, `opcode` - 5 bits
- 32 bits total

- data in - 32 bit dat value
- `rA`, `rB` - 32 bits each

- multiplexer - chooses which inpuh
    - Multiplexer knows when to do a certain instruction by the controller that's behind the scenes.
