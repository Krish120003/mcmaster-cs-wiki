# Physical RAM Implementations

![](/images/20221110103834.png)

## Static RAM (SRAM)
- Similar to a latch
- High-power consumption
- low latency, high access speed

## Dynamic RAM (DRAM)
- Similar to a capacitor
- Low-power consumption
- Higher-latency, slower access

# Measures of Memory Technology
- ***Density*** - how much data can we store per unit chip area?
- ***Latency and Cycle Time***
    - ***Latency*** - How long do read/write operations take? 
    - ***Cycle time*** - average time per operation
- ***clock frequency*** - memory is managed by a microcontroller: what clock frequency?
    - Same as processor? (Synchronous)
    - different than processor? (asynchronous)

# Memory Organization

- memory bus - How many lines? (interface width/word size)
    - *parallel interface* - can access the data all at the same time
- Number of parallel connections define the ***transfer size***
- memory is *word addressable* (r/w ops apply to words)
- read-write operations apply to words

# Byte Addressing

- How do we access a single byte?
- *Virtual addresses* at processor level are byte addresses
- byte addresses `b`, word size `N`, `div` is integer division
- word = `b div N`
- offset = `b mod N`

## Powers of Two

- If `N` is a power of two: `N = 2^x` then:
- Division by `2^x` equivalent to shift by `x`
- modulo equivalent to truncation at `x` digits

# Alignment

- An integer is ***aligned*** if the bytes of the integer correspond to a word in the underlying physical memory
    - Integer composed of bytes `12, 13, 14, 15` is aligned, but `6,7,8,9` is not.
- ***byte alignment*** is some architectures is required, others with unaligned access result in lower performance
    - If an integer spans *2* words, the processor must perform *2* read operations
