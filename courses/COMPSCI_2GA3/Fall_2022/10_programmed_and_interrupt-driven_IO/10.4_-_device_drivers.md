# Device Drivers
- Abstraction for dealing with devices
- Lower half: runs asynchronously
    - *low-level* part of the driver
    - comprised of a handler that is invoked when an interrupt occurs
- Upper half: provides OS interface to user-space programs (system calls)
    - *high-level* of the driver
    - programs are in here like main.c programs
    - Takes calls and puts it in a queue (*shared variables*) for things for the device to do
- Communication via shared variables, buffers, and mutually exclusive execution (mutex)

# System calls and standard libraries
System calls provide access to devices, but this access is *raw*. Library functions provide wrappers.
| system call | libstdc wrapper |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| open        | fopen           |
| close       | fclose          |
| read        | fread           |
| write       | fwrite          |
| seek        | fseek           |
