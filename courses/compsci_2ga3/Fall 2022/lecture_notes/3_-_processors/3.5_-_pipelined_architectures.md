# RISC and CISC ISA
## Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC)
- Each instruction performs a complex operation
- Instructions take variable number of clock cycles
- Fewer instruction calls

#### Example
x86

## Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC)
- Each instruction performs simple operation
- Instructions all take same number of clock cycles
- Many instruction calls

#### Example
Arm, Risc-V

# Pipelining
- Computational architecture, improved throughput
- Conditions to use a pipeline computational architecture:
	- Computation can be divided in distinct stages
	- Each stage takes similar time to complete
	- It is efficient to move data between stages

# Risc Pipeline
![](/images/20220930010451.png)
==NOTE:== pipeline of the five hardware stages that are used to perform the fetch-execute cycle.
- When a clock ticks, all stages pass instruction to the right.
- Not all pipelines have 5 stages

#### Example: pipelining

- At step 6, must make sure steps 3 and 4 are done
    - need `r5` and `r4`, which were modified from steps 3 and 4
    - There's a *stall* on step 6, so nothing gets passed to stage 3 in step 7
    - At stage 10-11, no instruction will be finished.
- At step 9, we do not know to jump to instruction 1
    * We read the instructions after instruction 7
* At step 14, we do know to jump to instruction 1
    * All instructions before this are invalidated
    * We flush the pipeline
    * Stall for 5 whole cycles

# Dealing with Hazards
- **Data hazards** - waiting for data from earlier instruction
    - Could happen because of data in a register.
    - It must be produced by the processor
    - Waiting for data to be produced
- **Control hazards** - incorrect instruction is in the pipeline (branching)
    - occurs when the pipeline makes wrong decisions on branch prediction and therefore brings instructions into the pipeline that must subsequently be discarded
- **Structural hazards** - resource conflict
    - Something has blocked the memory read from the outside
    - Somebody else is accessing the memory, so the processor has to wait

## How to Resolve them
- **Data hazards** - waiting for data from earlier instruction
    - Can rearrange the order of computation in the pipeline
        - Result should not change
    - *Data forwarding*
        - Data is available, but just not in stage 5
        - Can take the data directly from a middle stage
- **Control hazards** - incorrect instruction is in the pipeline (branching)
    - conditional branch prediction. If prediction wrong, flush pipline.
- **Structural hazards** - resource conflict
    - load data in parallel using banks

#### Example: Document Stalls

- Loads data into registers
- labels identify a particular location in assembly
- In this instruction set, assignment of an operand goes into the last register
